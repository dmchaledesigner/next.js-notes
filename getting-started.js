// installing NEXT


// Getting Started
// =================
// 1. open terminal and navigate into root folder
// 2. run npx-create-next-app .
// 3. run npm run dev to start the project





// React pages are relative to the url paths
// =================================
// If we create a page called news.js inside the pages folder then the url for that page will be mydomain.com/news
// They hold the same kind of functional components as React.
// Every page will have a base functional component that we can pass props and functions etc




// The public Folder
// =================
// Anthing inside this folder is a direct path from the domain
// public => myimage.jpg => mydomain.com.myimage.jpg



// CSS
// For using css in individual pages we cannot import style.css though we can do this in the _app.js file as that is the root document
// Pages require a mystyle.module.css file name.
// Its recommended to have different CSS files for components and pages alike.




// Components and Pages Naming conventions
//  Components => MyComponent.js  => React components always start with uppercase
//  Pages => myPage.js   => Next Pages always start with lowercase
